# PRWEB-Spring

<h1> Required tools </h1>
• Java JDK (with version from 8 to 16). Currently, you should use a JDK version < 16 because
compatibility is not fully ensured for version 16.
</br>
• Tomcat 9 (version 9 and 10 are quite different and may require changes in used libraries)
</br>
• Netbeans 12.0 or more (if possible 12.4 or more), and maven if possible
</br>
• JQuery file
</br>
• PostgreSQL server, if possible version 12 or more
</br>
